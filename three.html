They’ve lost 99 percent of the time. Some appeal, and then they lose again in court. Once a driver is found misclassified, they’re owed years of expense reimbursements, overtime and missed rest breaks. The judgements levied against them can total in the millions -- hundreds of thousands for individual drivers. A financial setback for some companies, but a fatal blow for most.</p>

       <p data-center="opacity:0;" data-center-bottom="opacity:1">So far the industry has been charged $22.3 million in total back wages. But they’ve paid just 12 percent of that. Most drivers have remained independent contractors, driving for the same company they sued.</p>

       <p data-center="opacity:0;" data-center-bottom="opacity:1">Companies have found ways to make the wage claims disappear -- sometimes by disappearing themselves. The dray, global trade’s weak link, spreads thin up and down the coast. There are a lot of places to hide.</p>

        <p><span class="firstcharacter">“T</span>here’s a number of things I’ve done internally that I don’t publicize,” one company president said, “to protect assets, to make the company dispensable basically.” He requested anonymity for fear of being “targeted by the Teamsters.” A board member of the Harbor Trucking Association, the president has tried using employees before, but after a few months, the workers comp costs alone almost bankrupt him, and he switched back to independent contractors. Now he’s preparing to get sued by “splitting the company up” within itself. “Quite frankly, if any company -- whether it’s the Department of Labor or what kind of situation it is -- it will put them out of business. Quite frankly, I’m not keen to going out of business.”</p>

        <p>Companies haven’t paid most of what’s been levied against them because nobody has held them to it. For years, enforcing labor standards has not been easy at the Department of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), an arm of the labor commissioner. DLSE and investigators say that’s mostly a function of speed and workload. The resource-strapped labor commissioner can take years to make a judgement after a worker files a wage complaint. That gives “unscrupulous employers” opportunity to “play shell games, declare bankruptcy, and hide assets under different corporations,” said Eunice Choi at the Southern Poverty Law Project.</p>

        <p>Anthony Mischel, a retired hearing officer at the labor commissioner, said labor code mandates hearings to be held within 90 days of the complaint. “But the reality,” he said, “is closer to a year.” A starved staff “gives people a long time to go out of business or disappear.” Mischel’s former hearing office handles more than 33,000 new wage claims a year with 200 people on staff, up 25 percent since 2012.</p>

        <p>Because of the flood of port trucking wage claims, the Long Beach office formed an ad hoc legal team to handle company appeals specific to the industry. Three labor DLSE lawyers work on nothing but port trucking cases every day. The legal arm of the department is crucial because when a company appeals, they don’t take the drivers to court, but actually the labor commissioner. Nonprofits like LAANE usually exit the scene after the administration level. So it becomes their job -- those three attorneys -- to uphold the judgement passed down from the hearing officer.</p>

        <p>“There was a strain put on the office we were not expecting,” said David Gurley, one of the state’s attorneys. “We had to adjust.” That adjustment has so far been slow to the take.</p>

        <p>Labor Commissioner Julie Su addressed the issue in a May 2013 memo: “The Division’s inability to act quickly more often than not turned judgments into nothing more than paper tigers.” Only 17 percent of California workers who won wage claims recovered any payment at all between 2008 and 2011, according to the latest labor commissioner data released by the National Economic Law Project. Of the $282 million awarded in that time period, workers employers paid less than 15 percent. Last year, only a quarter of the $41 million in penalties assessed across all industries was collected. It’s no different in the dray.</p>

        <p>Port trucking companies can vanish as quietly as they appeared. Drivers only realize once their case is deep in the court system that they’d been leasing from a shell company, indirectly owned by the name on their check. Once owners learn they’re being sued, that shell company can move assets -- like trucks, money and customer accounts -- to another, under a different name, and then file for bankruptcy. “The companies’ entire legal strategy,” labor lawyer Jean Choi said, “is complete denial. They never own up to the fact that they misclassify drivers. They file for bankruptcy, say ‘fuck you’ to the drivers, and they try to run away with the money.”</p>

        <p>Of the $22.3 million levied by the labor commissioner, only $2.7 million has been paid out so far in the dray, according to records obtained by the IRP. The total levied does not include all cases in late 2015 and 2016, so it’s likely the payment disparity is even greater. “It’s like missing the punchline on our whole joke,” said Sheheryar Kaoosji at LAANE. And companies are even less likely to pay when the civil suits start piling on</p>

        <p>In a 600-page decision this past February, the labor commissioner awarded 37 different drivers at one company, Pacific 9 Transportation, a total of $7 million this past February -- $2 million more than the next three biggest cases combined. The labor commissioner evaluated each driver individually and the testimonies were consistent: 16 to 20 hours a day for five or six days a week. Several quit after receiving weekly paychecks below $100, some had negative balances. Some didn’t know what an employee was let alone an independent contractor. Others couldn’t read in Spanish let alone English. Some were regularly told to doctor manifests and driving logs to comply with DOT regulations if they went over. Some testified to driving so many consecutive hours they crashed their truck.</p>

        <p>One driver, Faustino Denova said he trusted his boss and dispatcher when they handed him a release to sign and $1,000. He thought he was getting a bonus for working hard. His father was sick and he was already a month behind on rent. The release, in fact, was meant to waive his rights to a wage claim. It was thrown out in court along with other frivolous company protections in the contract, like the arbitration clause.</p>

        <p>Pacific 9 filed for bankruptcy in April, listing 37 different debts -- about $182,000 on average -- as its cause for insolvency. One driver was awarded $386,000. The defense attorneys who have represented several of the companies argue it’s no surprise that these “astronomical amounts” aren’t getting paid. “Nobody can afford them,” one said.</p>

        <p>It’s not an excuse the drivers’ attorneys are keen to hear. Choi, the LAANE lawyer who represented the Pacific 9 drivers, said their battle is long from over. The bankruptcy effectively puts a stay on all the company’s debts, while allowing it to continue operations. “It’s gotten to the point where I tell my client straight up, ‘Winning a wage complaint at the labor commissioner’s office or in court is 10 percent of the battle. Don’t expect that to get you anything. It’s not going to get you anywhere. It’s the collections game that’s so rigged in favor of employers. It favors businesses so much. So much deference is given to businesses when they go into bankruptcy.”</p>

        <p>Matt Sirolly, a labor lawyer at the Wage Justice Center, said absconding and non-enforcement are common problems in low-wage industries. “Companies use various little tricks to avoid liability for wage theft.” He said trucking industries are unique because the trucks themselves are high-value assets, so “the shell games are at a higher level.” The labor commissioner contracts his firm to chase down companies trying to duck payment.</p>

        <p>Sirolly is currently untangling the most complex bankruptcy scheme in port trucking. Lawyers call QTS Inc. the “hydra company” and it’s a case study in how some companies have responded to the attack on their business model.</p>

        <p><span class="firstcharacter">Q</span>TS filed for bankruptcy in August 2014, hitting the stop button on its many pending civil cases. The Wage Justice Center has since sued for “consolidation” in bankruptcy court, asking a jury to lump together all of the companies that have the same owners, cash flows and equipment, so that drivers can recoup the “ill-gotten gains” that the company is “shielding, through corporate shell games.”</p>

        <p>One of the QTS-related companies, WinWin Logistics, was levied a $3.6 million judgement from misclassification back wages in October of 2014, while it was still running operations at the ports. The company also has the largest single settlement payment in the industry’s history: It paid one driver $204,000 in August of 2015. The company’s trips in and out of the ports stopped that year. It disappeared from the harbor, but WinWin remained alive in QTS’s emails and bank statements.</p>

        <p>More than 20 drivers (plus dozens of unnamed) are listed as creditors in QTS’s August 2014 bankruptcy filing, totaling $10 million in unpaid claims from class action and individual suits, as well as labor commissioner judgements. The testimonies against the company were damning: loan sharking with drivers’ own security deposits, 80-hour work weeks, withholding payments, and retaliation for complaints. They even billed drivers who had quit for lease payments on trucks they would clearly never own. All the cases started with misclassification.</p>

        <p>One driver said management plopped large stacks of paper in front of him, in English, and demanded he sign. They were revised lease agreements, stating again and again that he was an independent contractor (at the time he didn’t know what that meant.) “I was not provided my paycheck until I signed.”</p>

        <p>““I would lose money from all the deductions if I did not work,” another testified. He often slept in his truck on the road outside the company's fence. “If I worked Saturday, I would net maybe $75. But if I did not work I would lose money.”</p>

        <p>The Wage Justice Center said misclassification was “knowing, systematic, deliberate, extended in duration, and constitutes a practice of violations,” an accusation affirmed in trial court. Nothing new there. But what’s unique about QTS is the lengths the company has gone to skirt the judgements levied against them, while remaining in the container business -- strategies shown in bank statements, emails, testimonies and monthly operating reports. At least five different entities, including WinWin, shared common managers and leased trucks through the same paper financial company, B&G Transport, Inc., which has held the truck titles for all the companies since the Clean Air Program. All the owners are related, either by marriage or blood, to one Erik Yoo.</p>

        <p>After drivers started filing wage claims, the companies moved hundreds of thousands into the same “Yoo Family Trust.” And by the time QTS filed for bankruptcy on August 10, 2014, all four companies had shifted their customer clients to a fifth company, C&JJ Express Inc., which was incorporated that morning, also owned by Yoo.</p>

        <p>The Wage Justice Center’s motion for consolidation is currently under review. Yoo could not be reached for comment. QTS’ former attorney Naveen Madala denied that the company is hiding through shell games. But, he said, every company looking down the barrel right now is in for “a losing fight.” That fight started with the lease agreement, which “had no guidance from the courts or government.”</p>

        <p class="long-quote">“The problem is that [QTS] mixed the lease with the operation,” Madala said. “It would have been better if they kept it secret, if they didn’t do deductions but just took it, like a check, or paid indirectly. That would have removed the risk. The problem is they mixed everything together, accounting operations, everything, it looks like everything is one. The system was not a good system.

        <p><span class="firstcharacter">Q</span>TS is one of many, in every industry, that takes advantage of a slow claims process. In response to UCLA’s “Hollow Victories” report in 2012, which showed the department’s poor enforcement rates, the labor commissioner drafted Senate Bill 588. It functions as a levee, requiring employers to post a bond once they’ve been ruled against in a wage hearing.</p>

        <p>The labor commissioner's attorneys haven’t used the levee yet, but they’re hoping it might be the first step in closing the gap between judgment and payment, money owed and money collected, paper tiger and enforcement. They hope that once the payment percentage rises, so will compliance, which has become something of a personal goal for the lawyers.</p>

        <p>““Every single driver that we’ve represented has just really shown us the emotional toll,” Edna Garcia Earley said. She remembers once a dray trucker had lost his teeth from the anxiety of suing his company. “We’ve had several cases where the drivers just break down and start crying because of what they’ve been through.”</p>

         <p class="caption">Today’s megaships can hold as many as 60,000 containers. The pace and size at which they arrive at American ports has outstripped their capacity to receive them. As a result, containers jam, and trucks take longer to find the ones they need.</p>

         <h1 class="section_titles">Chokepoints</h1>

         <p><span class="firstcharacter">M</span>ARCH 2016 -- At 6:45 am on a chilly Saturday, Edgardo Villatoro pulled out of the XPO lot and drove toward the Port of Long Beach. He thought because trade lulls around the Chinese New Year, it might be a quick in-and-out. Others thought the same. He joined a line of hundreds of trucks idling outside the terminal. Container cranes stabbed through the fog, while men walked between the tires toward a taco truck. Spanish-language talk radio played low behind the beeping dashboard. He needs to replace the engine coolant. His driving logs show that he regularly works 10 or 11 hour days. Villatoro says after expenses and the lease payments, his take-home pay is close to $22,000 a year, just enough to disqualify his family from Medi-Cal.</p>

         <p>He hoped to turn a four-hour round trip from the port, to the warehouse and back to XPO; home by the afternoon. He had a 3 pm eye appointment at Wal-Mart to get fitted for glasses: $300, out of pocket. A diabetic, his vision has gotten so bad that the DMV won’t renew his license in March unless he gets glasses.</p>

         <p>Waiting like this, he said, is part of everyday life, not a choice. There is no way to work harder. “Even if you want to do more, you can't here,” he said, flicking his wrist to the endless line of taillights through the fog. On the other side of the fence, giant cranes moved stacks of containers like lego bricks. “That is the problem. The waiting line in the ports.”</p>

<div class="container section">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3 mobile-fix">

        <p>Container traffic today is at an all time high. And tomorrow will probably be a new record. Combined imports and exports have double to almost 300 million tons (about 16 million containers) in the last two decades, according to federal maritime data. A quarter of those containers comes through California, and most need to get on a truck once stateside. Megaships longer than the Empire State Building on its belly carry as many as 65,000 at once.</p>

        <p>The waterfront has been slow to catch up. Ships bottleneck, and the containers stack on the dockyard like a city of windowless buildings. Turn times -- the duration it takes a driver to get in and out of the terminal -- have flatlined. So trucks jam at all hours. A recent program from California State tracked an average turn time of 88 minutes, the highest ever recorded. (Though it’s important to note that data was collected using GPS tracking that previous studies hadn’t.) And that doesn’t count the time waiting outside the gate. Truck drivers say that’s where they do the bulk of their waiting. Add to that their three-hour round trip to the warehouse.</p>

        <p>Long waits can bankrupt a drayage driver. Last year when the longshoremen slowed down operations during a contract spat, several truckers went out of business. Every port on the West Coast came to a crawl. A research firm commissioned by the terminal operators, E2ManageTech, reported that average turn time shot up 60 percent when gridlock was at its worst. Some companies had to start paying wait time surcharges just to keep most of their independent contractors afloat.</p>

        <p>Many point to congestion as the force that awakened the drivers. Disenchanted and suddenly indebted, the drivers would make more money if they could only pull more turns. The fractured fleet of trucks can’t possibly keep up with a consolidated armada of ships, efficient and unrelenting. When Villatoro finally gets into the dockyard, it will take the terminal operators five different containers to find his buried below. There’s no pre-ordering or planned stacking. Villatoro just gives the gate guard a container number and the longshoremen have to go find it.</p>

        <p>The drayage companies say clearing the chokepoints would be the first step in stabilizing the market.  Drayage companies say the inefficiencies of globalization are to blame for the poor working conditions of their drivers, that streamlining efficiency will turn the industry around. But that takes a level of cooperation with several links in the supply chain: the steamship lines, the terminal operators, the longshoremen, the warehouses, the long-haul truckers, the distribution centers, and, finally, the retailers. In real terms, that means pushing costs upwards, charging more for each container, which will translate into higher price tags at the store.</p>

        <p>Many on the land side say consolidation -- even by means of regulation -- could treat some of the symptoms of a hyper-competitive market, like pervasive misclassification. It’s no secret that the shipping industry has consolidated while land has atomized. A single conglomerate of three companies -- the P3 alliance -- owns 40 percent of the trans-Atlantic trade market, and 24 percent of the Pacific. Bigger, faster ships deliver containers at a rate terminals can’t match, either in size or speed. Many of those shipping companies have vertical operations into the dray. But they’ve tried to remain out of the discussions when it comes to independent contractors. John Cushing, a representative from the terminal operators association in Los Angeles, said getting involved with port trucking companies “it’s not our business to stick our noses in.”</p>

        <p>The dray is the most cash-strapped leg of logistics, and the rest of the chain seems at peace with that. Retail companies deal exclusively with the shipping world, an arms length from the logistics networks that delivers its goods stateside. It’s a cost-saving measure. But that distance has buckled under the pressure of a global economy bigger than the ports through which it flows. Companies are out of options, and drivers have long been out of money. Now, after deregulation and the clean trucks program have come to a head, the industry has reached its third hour.</p>

        <p><span class="firstcharacter">V</span>ic LaRosa has been president of Total Transportation Services Inc. for 20 years. In that time, he’s watched the far end of the supply chain fray. “If the operators, the stakeholders in all of the communities would operate across all lines as opposed to operating in their silos. Like the marine terminal operators, steamship lines another silo, the trucking companies a third silo, the BCOs [retailers] in their silo. If everyone would work in conjunction, you wouldn't have these problems.”</p>

        <p>LaRosa stressed that the dray is the worst offender. “Ship to the warehouse is the inefficient part of the supply chain. That's the part that's broken.” For decades, his company had grown from modestly successful to one of the biggest firms in Southern California, with some 200 independent contractors in his fleet.  “The most expensive part, mile for mile, of that supply chain, is the dray.”</p>

        <p>For him, it’s been especially expensive. He paid out almost $600,000 in misclassification claim settlements in 2014 and 15. Then the labor commissioner levied almost $7 million more in claims this past March.</p>

        <p>John Rosenthal is the president of an equity firm that owns TTSI. He said the political and legal climate flipped without fair warning, that companies never had a chance to comply because nobody, not even regulators, understood the law.</p>

        <p class="long-quote">“We used the best lawyers we could find,” Rosenthal said. “Every company I’m sure did. Why is it that they got it wrong? Why is it, five years later, that the courts are uniformly saying that despite the fact you used your best effort, despite the fact that you read the law and you had it was interpreted by council, you were wrong five years ago. We are going to now impose what is effectively a new standard, expo facto. And we are going to impose millions of dollars of fines. That is what is happening today.”</p>

        <p>“You mean besides from you and me, and everyone else who buys stuff from stores?” said Kristen Monaco, a division chief at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. She spent her previous career conducting academic surveys of the trucking industry, with a particular interest in independent contractors at the ports. “And the interests who like the setup the way it is, also spend a lot of time talking to people on the Hill as well.”</p>

        <p>Big retailers cut deals with international shipping conglomerates -- monoliths on two ends of the supply chain. They negotiate a “door price,” and every atomized link between, from drayage drivers and warehouse pickers, to seafarers and longshoremen, gets a slice. Consumers in the age of Amazon create pressure at the shelf-level, and that pressure flows down and down until it hits the floor, where a landscape of low-wage, immigrant workers have no leverage or bargaining power. No recourse. “Of all the global trade related logistics workers,” sociologist Edna Bonacich said, “port truckers are the most oppressed.”</p>

        <p>TTSI filed for bankruptcy in February.</p>

        <p>It happens to truck drivers every single day in the dray.</p>

        <p>Villatoro’s still driving, though, still waiting in a double barrel line of trucks like ants without marching orders. Bottles of urine and tobacco spit lay on the pavement by his tires. His engine coolant light still beeping.</p>

        <p>There’s a question people like to ask those stuck in a bad way: Why not leave like the others? It’s etched in the American ethos, the land of second chances. It’s what brings immigrants here. It’s why a drayage company can file for bankruptcy in the Los Angeles dray then reopen in Long Beach the next day. Failure shouldn’t extinguish a future.</p>

<!-- 
        <p>All over the country, dray drivers are in a similar situation as Cauley: most, if not all of their time and money tied up in a truck. They drive for the same company every day. In a 2009 study from the University of North Florida, 98 percent of the independent contractors surveyed in Jacksonville indicated they were “not allowed to work for other firms.” The author of that study summarized his respondent’s general sentiment about the industry in two words: “It sucks.” Cauley agrees. </p>  -->

        <p>So what’s keeping those still behind the wheel in their seat? In an industry with 100 percent turnover, it seems a fair enough question for those burdened with the inefficiencies of global trade. Villatoro’s wife asks him every day.</p>

        <p>“If we leave now,” he tells her, “then we will lose everything.” Just a couple more years, then he’ll own the truck, then things will get better. The only way up is further down. “Here we are in God's will,” he said, just before traffic started moving outside the terminal. “There's nothing, nothing. No retirement. Nothing.”</p>

        <p>The National Economic Law Project, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy firm, estimates that 82 percent of the country’s 100,000 port truck drivers are classified as independent contractors. NELP analyzed a dozen different academic surveys of some 2,100 drivers, placing their median net earnings around $29,000 per year, working an average of 59 hours a week -- or about $8.80 an hour. (It’s important to note that the NELP report was in part sponsored by LAANE, a labor activist group that works closely with the Teamsters. But several independent surveys before and after have found similar data.)</p>

        <p>What was once considered a sub-sector in a classic American industry, blue-collar work for middle class income, has since fallen into a sad state of disrepair. Many drivers today are asking themselves: What happened to the job?</p>

        <p>Since 1980, port trucking has drawn the working poor in droves, a lasting consequence of the Carter Administration’s economic deregulation. The Motor Carrier Act -- really more of a detariffing measure -- lifted mandatory licenses, rate scales and routes. It let retailers and shippers compare companies and take the best deals in a market that previously had strict rules for who could and couldn’t operate where. Freight movement became a buyer’s paradise.</p>
        
        <p>It tore down barriers to entry across trucking, dismantling the Teamsters while marshaling in waves of new drivers, mostly uneducated immigrants. In Los Angeles, 94 percent of drivers are hispanic, 89 percent foreign born, and about 70 percent have only a high school diploma or less. Every port has its own ethnic profile of truck drivers: Hispanics are the majority at every California port, with a large Sikh and Vietnamese population in the northern cities like Oakland; Ethiopians and Somalis in Seattle and Tacoma; Puerto Ricans, Hispanics and Eastern Europeans in New York; African Americans in Savannah and Jacksonville.</p>

        <p>As a white woman, Cauley is a statistical unicorn in the dray. She said she spent the early years just proving herself among the men, fighting for containers, while trying to save up enough to move her sons out of the projects. In another life, she had dreamt of being a wedding caterer. But at the time, 10 years ago, port trucking seemed like the quickest way to turn things around. And it was way easier to get into than dental hygiene school.</p>
        
        <p>After deregulation, the number of truck drivers nationwide grew to 2.9 million, a 75 percent jump, between 1973 and 1995, even as real wages fell by 21 percent in that same period. People like Hernandez and Cauley could take a class, and climb behind the wheel. Teamster membership fell from 55 to 25 percent, and concentrated into niches away from the dray. The dipping cost in freight movement invited rapid expansion of offshoring and global trade, creating a feedback loop: more trade requires more drivers who, in turn, encourage cheaper trade.</p>

        <p>Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich said it’s the exact kind of environment that invites the most vulnerable into the workforce.</p>
